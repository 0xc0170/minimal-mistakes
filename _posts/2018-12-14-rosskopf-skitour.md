It has been colder lately with couple of days when it was snowing. The conditions are finally good enough for an (on-piste) ski tour. The idea was to choose something short and close to Munich, so we can get to work afterwards.

We have chosen to go to Roßkopf. Leaving Munich at 6.20 to we started skinning up little past 7. We started from the parking lot next to the lift - it was almost empty and quite cold with -9°C and clear skies.

The way to the top goes along the piste. I took us around 50min to reach Roßkopf - the view is great. We took the black piste to go down. The piste was little icy, but it felt great to finally ski. On the way down we met around 10 more people going up. 

Overall much recomended for early birds who want to ski before work, with almost zero natural risks. Might be a little boring for those extreme adventurers among us.
