This is going to be slightly longer blog than our weekend trip. We were 5 of us going to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan this summer for 4 weeks. Our proposal was to spend 3 weeks hiking and one week sighseeing plus traveling.

The beginning of our trip start in Samarkand. There's small airport where only few flights land per week. Most of them are from Moscov, one we took as well. We arrived very early, at 5 am to Samarkand. Unfortunately, my backpack did not arrive with us so I had to deal with the crew of Aeroflot there. We were able to find someone to communicate in English however they were quite convinced my backpack would not be in the flight right after ours, few hours later as it was not Aeroflot. As we were exhausted and convinced my backpack will arrive on Sunday to Buchara - that was our agreement with the crew there. As soon as we left the terminal building one taxi driver approached us. We experienced the first what we later named "vulture". His first proposal was way out of the price we were eager to pay. After our first refusal, he left and on the way to find other taxis, we agreed on the price. As our initial plan was to go directly to Tajikistan, we had to find a hotel and stay in Samarkand for a day. Hiking postponed until my backpack arrives.
