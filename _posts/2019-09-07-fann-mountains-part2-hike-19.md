Before we left Alaudin lakes to go higher up, I should mention how we packed as I received often a question how heavy were our backpacks, what was inside, etc. This article will desribe the longest hike we did without any civilization (no tea room or any opportunity to buy supplies). This part was supposed to take 15 days. The next stop where we could buy food or beverage would be in Iskanderkul. To get to Iskanderkul from Alaudin lakes you would normally go via Kaznok pass. As I recall it is 2-3 days hike but we wanted to visit Big Allo lake and prolong the hike. Besides food, we had 2 tents with us. 4 of us were sharing one (Stefan most of the time bivac outside) and Ivana one for herself. 2 ropes (20 and 30 meters in legth), full glacier equipment (the heavist part of our backpacks).

Our food supplies were mostly dried food. I bought drier before the trip. It run constantly for 3 weeks to dry everything I could.

Once we get back to Alaudin Vertical camp, we unpacked everything (we left few bags there with our stuff, not needed for our first part) and start packing again. This time we knew we need to be careful what we take with us - weight consideration and also to have enough food for 15 days. Our backpacks were around 22kg when we arrived to Samarkand but still we wanted to get rid of few things. We left 2 duffel bags that will be transfered to Iskanderkul for 100 dollars. After careful consideration, we were ready to go back to Alaudin lake and continue to Mutnyi lake the next day. The funny thing is our backpacks were always full no matter how much we ate. It became lighter but still stuffed to the top.

We realized our backpacks are heavy and we still have to go up to 4700m soon. First, Mutnyi lake camp spot. It is couple of hours from Alaudin lakes. We come here early afternoon and found a spot on the left side of the lake - to get there you need to jump dozen of big rocks. There was a stream of water (from melting snow. This is where we got our water from) and no one just us here. We set up our camp and prepared for the next day - the first 4000 meters peak - Granuleta. There was still plenty of snow at 3500 m.a.s.l, we knew we will need crampons and ice axes for Granuleta.

20.7 - Early start in the morning meant snow was hard and streams frozen. I almost crashed my knee while crossing one stream and put my foot on slippery rock. Lesson learned, need to be more careful in the morning. The snow was slowly melting by sun radiation so once we got below Granuleta, it was easy to walk on. We reached Granuleta, 4172 m.a.s.l without complications (the top part was a rock ridge) but otherwise everything was covered by snow. Guys wanted to take a different path so we split. They continued to unknown to us ridge to explore. Me and Ivana returned the same way. The snow became mashy and I slided at least twice (I made not-planned self arrest). It tooks us around 5 hours to go up and back from to Granuleta. We met Belgian couple who were not equiped for current condition (ice axe or crampons). Chimtarga pass was covered with snow almost all way up. They were waiting for some people to make a path and better conditions. The next day group of around 8 people went up and this couple followed the next day. 

The next day we did glacier training to revise what we knew or we did not. The plan for later afternoon was to go up to Zamok glacier. 

21.7 - Only 4 of us went up to Zamok glacier. Ivana stayed at Mutnyi lakes and made her own plan for the next 2 days. We arrived below Zamok before sunset. There was water stream near the camping place where we got water from. We observed the glacier, finding a way for tomorrow. The next morning my friends started after 7 am. I decided to rest so stayed in the tent. It took them a half day at least, I noticed them on the glacier in early afternoon. I was worried for a while that it took them that long (it could me waiting for so long there). We had quick lunch and returned back to Mutnyi lakes. The same spot as previously, we left few things hidden there in the rocks. Repacked again and prepared for the next day - going up to Chimtarga pass. The highest point with all our stuff. 

23.7 - We started early as usual. Noticed few other people going up. We overtook them once they rested. We found out they are from Czech republic and going as well up to Energia. We continued all the way up to the Chimtarga pass with short break to meet Ivana again after 2 days. She camped at 4500 m.a.s.l but we wanted to sleep over in the saddle. There was again streams from melting snow at 4500 m.a.s.l. We refilled all our bottles/camelbaks as we were not certain if we can find something up in the saddle. There was no one in the saddle just us. The sunset was spectacular as well as views!

24.7 - our todays mission - Energia peak. 2 russian hikers started earlier than us and were already climbing up while we were preparing. As we started ascending, soon enough snow turned to ice. We started using ropes. We all worked hard to have fixed rope for all us for safety. The surface was very good for ice screws, we had problems only rarely to put them in. However as we were 4 of us (Stefan stayed down to rest), it took us longer than expected (the beginning was slow to distribute the work and find good balance). There were lot of ropes for abseil. We believe somebody put them up there just this season as we did not recall any mention from the previous years. After 6 hours, we were back at our tent. Without much hesitation, we agreed to go down. Some of us were convinced we could go down all the way to Big Allo. As Stefan started earlier, we cought him up later in the evening. He already was resting and wanted to stay overnight. We decided to stay with him and just bivouc outside.

25.7 - We moved to Big Allo where we stayed for almost 2 days. Finally a rest day

26.7 - We are moving in the late afternoon up to Smaller Allo lake, to be closer to the saddle and find out the conditions up there. The trail was not visible all the way up. There was some scrambling involved around Big Allo, challenging with back packs but we helped each other. Follow the valley up to the Smaller Allo. First we were confused where to go the next day, there were couple of saddles on the left side. Realizing we did not wanted to cross glacier, we found our proposed trail.

27.7 - The ascent to the Dvoinoi saddle was easy. The snow was solid, the rocks as well. There was still plenty snow on the other side. Berezovo lake was covered by snow, no swimming there as we hoped. We crossed the lake on the right side to find another saddle and going all the way down to the valley. There were sheppards in the valley. We were offered tea and bread. We took nice afternoon break and talked to them. Only the oldest sheppard spoke Russian. He explained they stay there 4-5 months (when winter is not up there) and have hundreds of sheeps and goats. They were very generous. Very nice experiance. We hoped to be down soon but not so fast! It tooks us tremendous time to get down to the valley which leads to Kaznok pass. We had one challenging cross through river and very long way. We reached the camping place in the late evening, completely exhausted. My feet were swollen so were causing pain in the boots for the first time. I knew this is not good but had to resist. Of course, down in the valley were hundreds of mosquitos making our evening rest not pleasant.

28.7 - We continued along the river down to Iskanderkul. There was one challening river cross - damaged bridge. It has been for few years but still sufficiently solid to be crossed. My friends crossed without hesitation. I had a help with backpack and crossed as well. The another side of the river was good compare to the previuos one where the trail was damaged due to water or snow, so sometimes our steps were on very non solid steep surface right above the wild river (lot of water due to melting snow). After two hours we saw the first building after 2 weeks - is this real ? It is made from stones and has a new roof ! This was a guest house where we met another Slovak girl (what a coincidece to meet a Slovak person here). We had great lunch and beer with rest. We were ready for Iskanderkul. We found a taxi to bring us down to Iskanderkul otherwise we would just walk on the road.

The accomodation we found was not that pleasent after all. There were so many mosquitos. We have never experienced anything like this. Hundreds of them everywhere. We stayed one night next to the "Snake lake". Our 2 rest days were shorten to just one day. Our goal was to get out of here and back to mountains.

30.7 - We are back in mountains. We got a taxi yesterday. Time to visit Hissar mountains. First night was in the middle of meadows. We started going up through the valley, following the stream. Our goal of today was to get closer to the saddle we wanted to cross the next day - Nadezda saddle. We found good spot with water streams 300 meters below the trail going up to the saddle.

31.7 - Ascending early in the morning. We realized we do not need to cross glacier from this side, it waits for us on the other side. There was a note in Nadezda saddle, the last note was from 2015. We added ours. Time to use rope and we are back on glacier. This time, all of us together crossing few glaciers. We have to get to the next saddle, going almost straight and then cross another glacier to get us below Usko saddle. This took us couple of hours. It is flat and bit boring but need to be careful as there are cracks from time to time and some crevasses but nothing big.

1.9 - Time to go back. We decided we got enough of hiking. Not all of us agreed firstly but later we all did. Time to go back to Iskanderkul. Me, Martin and Tomas decide to go to Dushanbe, to explore the city and travel a bit. Ivana and Stefan stayed in the mountains for one more night and return to Iskanderkul. 3 of us going back to Iskanderkul was an entire day hike.
