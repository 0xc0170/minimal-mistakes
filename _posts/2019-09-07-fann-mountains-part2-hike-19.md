Before we leave Alaudin lakes, I should mention how we packed as I received often a question how heavy were our backpacks, what was inside, etc. This article will desribe the longest hike we did without any civilization (no tea room or anything). It was planned for 15 days. The next stop where we could buy food or beverage would be in Iskanderkul. This would be normally via Kaznok pass 2-3 days hike but we wanted to stand of few summits along the way and visit Big Allo lake. Longer and more interesting trail. Besides food, we had 2 tents with us. 4 of us were sharing one (Stefan most of the time bivac outside) and Ivana one for herself. 2 ropes (20 and 30 meters in legth), full glacier equipment (the heavist part of our backpacks).

Once we get back to Alaudin Vertical camp, we unpacked everything (we left few bags there with our stuff, not needed for our first part) and start packing again. This time we knew we need to be careful with packing and have enough food for 15 days. Our backpacks were around 22kg when we arrived to Samarkand but still we wanted to get rid of few things. These things will be transfered to Iskanderkul for 100 dollars as agreed. Our friends had 2 duffelbags where each of us left own things. After careful consideration, we were ready to go back to Alaudin lake and continue to Mutnyi lake the next day.

We realized our backpacks are heavy for the first time and have to go up to 4700m in couple of days. First, Mutnyi lake. It is couple of hours from Alaudin lakes. We come here early afternoon and found a spot on the right side of the lake. There was a stream of water (melting snow. This is where we got our water from) and no one just us. We set up our camp and prepared for the next day. The first 4000 meters peak - Granuleta. There was still plenty of snow at 3500 m.a.s.l, we knew we will need crampons and ice axes for Granuleta.

Early start in the morning meant there was icy. The snow melting was ice and I almost crashed my knee while crossing one stream and put my foot on slippery rock. The snow was slowly melting by sun being higher so once we get below Granuleta, it was easy to walk on to make a path. We reached Granuleta, 4172 m.a.s.l without complications (the top part was rock ridge) but otherwise only snow. Guys wanted to take a different path so we split. They continued to unknown. Me and Ivana returned the same way. The snow became more loose and I slided at least twice (not planned self arrest). It tooks us around 5 hours entire hike to Granuleta. Later in the evening we met Belgian couple who were not equiped for current condition (ice axe or crampons). Chimtarga pass was covered with snow almost all way up. They were waiting for some people to make a path. The next day group of around 8 people went up and they followed the next day. We planned some glacier training in the morning. To revise what we knew or we did not. The plan for later afternoon was to go up to Zamok glacier. 

Only 4 of us went up to Zamok glacier. Ivana stayed at Mutnyi lakes and made her own plan for the next 2 days. We arrived below Zamok before sunset.
