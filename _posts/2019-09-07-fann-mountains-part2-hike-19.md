Before we left Alaudin lakes to go higher up, I should mention how we packed as I received often a question how heavy were our backpacks, what was inside, etc. This article will desribe the longest hike we did without any civilization (no tea room or any opportunity to buy supplies). This part was supposed to take 15 days. The next stop where we could buy food or beverage would be in Iskanderkul. To get to Iskanderkul from Alaudin lakes you would normally go via Kaznok pass. As I recall it is 2-3 days hike but we wanted to visit Big Allo lake and prolong the hike. Besides food, we had 2 tents with us. 4 of us were sharing one (Stefan most of the time bivac outside) and Ivana one for herself. 2 ropes (20 and 30 meters in legth), full glacier equipment (the heavist part of our backpacks).

Our food supplies were mostly dried food. I bought a drier before the trip. It ran constantly for 3 weeks to dry everything I could. We had over 1 kg of beef jerky thanks to that!

19.7 - Once we get back to Alaudin Vertical camp, we unpacked everything (we left few bags there with our stuff, not needed for our first part) and start packing again. This time we knew we need to be careful what we take with us - weight consideration and also to have enough food for 15 days. Our backpacks were around 22kg when we arrived to Samarkand but still we wanted to get rid of few things. We left 2 duffel bags that will be transfered to Iskanderkul for 100 dollars. After careful consideration, we were ready to go back to Alaudin lake and continue to Mutnyi lake the next day. The funny thing is our backpacks were always full no matter how much we ate. It became lighter but still stuffed to the top.

We realized our backpacks are heavy and we still have to go up to 4700m soon. First, Mutnyi lake camp spot. It is couple of hours from Alaudin lakes. We come here early afternoon and found a spot on the left side of the lake - to get there you need to jump dozen of big rocks. There was a stream of water (from melting snow. This is where we got our water from) and no one just us here. We set up our camp and prepared for the next day - the first 4000 meters peak - Granuleta. There was still plenty of snow at 3500 m.a.s.l, we knew we will need crampons and ice axes for Granuleta.

20.7 - Early start in the morning meant snow was hard and streams frozen. I almost crashed my knee while crossing one stream and put my foot on slippery rock. Lesson learned, need to be more careful in the morning. The snow was slowly melting by sun radiation so once we got below Granuleta, it was easy to walk on. We reached Granuleta, 4172 m.a.s.l without complications (the top part was a rock ridge) but otherwise everything was covered by snow. Guys wanted to take a different path so we split. They continued to unknown to us ridge to explore. Me and Ivana returned the same way. The snow became mashy and I slided at least twice (I made not-planned self arrest). It tooks us around 5 hours to go up and back from to Granuleta. We met Belgian couple who were not equiped for current condition (ice axe or crampons). Chimtarga pass was covered with snow almost all way up. They were waiting for some people to make a path and better conditions. The next day group of around 8 people went up and this couple followed the next day. 

21.7 - We did glacier training to revise what we knew or we did not. The plan for later afternoon was to go up to Zamok glacier. Only 4 of us went up to Zamok glacier. Ivana stayed at Mutnyi lakes and made her own plan for the next 2 days. We arrived below Zamok before sunset. There was water stream near the camping place where we got water from. We observed the glacier, finding a way for tomorrow. The next morning my friends started after 7 am. I decided to rest so stayed in the tent. It took them a half day at least, I noticed them on the glacier in early afternoon. I was worried for a while that it took them that long (it could me waiting for so long there). We had quick lunch and returned back to Mutnyi lakes. The same spot as previously, we left few things hidden there in the rocks. Repacked again and prepared for the next day - going up to Chimtarga pass. The highest point with all our stuff. 

23.7 - We started early as usual. Noticed few other people going up. We overtook them once they rested. We found out they are from Czech republic and going as well up to Energia. We continued all the way up to the Chimtarga pass with short break to meet Ivana again after 2 days. She camped at 4500 m.a.s.l but we wanted to sleep over in the saddle. There was again streams from melting snow at 4500 m.a.s.l. We refilled all our bottles/camelbaks as we were not certain if we can find something up in the saddle. There was no one in the saddle just us. The sunset was spectacular as well as views!

24.7 - our todays mission - Energia peak. 2 russian hikers started earlier than us and were already climbing up while we were preparing. As we started ascending, soon enough snow turned to ice. We started using ropes. We all worked hard to have fixed rope for all us for safety. The surface was very good for ice screws, we had problems only rarely to put them in. However as we were 4 of us (Stefan stayed down to rest), it took us longer than expected (the beginning was slow to distribute the work and find good balance). There were lot of ropes for abseil. We believe somebody put them up there just this season as we did not recall any mention from the previous years. After 6 hours, we were back at our tent. Without much hesitation, we agreed to go down. Some of us were convinced we could go down all the way to Big Allo. As Stefan started earlier, we cought him up later in the evening. He already was resting and wanted to stay overnight. We decided to stay with him and just bivouc outside.

25.7 - We moved to Big Allo where we stayed for almost 2 days. Finally a rest day for us. Swimming, sleeping and eating all day. We should move after the rest day to Iskanderkul, this will be described in the following blog post.
